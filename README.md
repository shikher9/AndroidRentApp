#Rent a House Android App
 
A native Android app that allows property owners to post their place for rent and tenants to find a place to stay. Property owners can post multiple places and will be notified whenever a tenant occupies their place for rent. Tenant can search for a place and save their search. Tenant will be notified if a new place is available which satisfies the saved search. Used push notifications for notifying tenant and property owner, using Google Cloud Messaging. Server made in Node.js, MongoDB as database and used RESTservices for communication with Android client. The source contains only the android app for now and does not include the node.js backend code.
